   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd signrequest_backend
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   - First install the virtual environemt
   ```bash
   python -m pip install virtualenv
   ```
   - Activate the virtual environment
   ```bash
   python -m env\scripts\activate (if you use VS code, it will automatically opens the virtual environment)
   ```
4. Install dependacies:
